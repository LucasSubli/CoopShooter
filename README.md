### Prerequisities

What things you need to have to be able to run:

* Unreal Engine - v4.15+
* Some C++ compiler and IDE (Visual Studio 2015+ recommended)
* Steam Online Subsystem and Steam Open when runiong the game
* A few assets that I used from the marketplace have been removed from their folders as I can't share them. Replace as needed.

## Notes

This is a code for learning how to program on the unreal engine, do not expect anything more than some blocks shooting spheres at other blocks with made-in-2-min custom FX.
